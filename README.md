To convert multiple JPEG (.jpg) images into a single TIFF (.tiff) file, you can use the Python library Pillow (PIL). This library allows image processing and manipulation, including converting and merging multiple images into a multi-page TIFF file.
Steps:
1.	Install Pillow: If you don't have the library installed, you can install it using pip.
2.	Open and combine images: Open the .jpg files, convert them to a format suitable for TIFF, and save them as one .tiff file.
3.	Save as multi-page TIFF: You can use the save() method with the append_images parameter to append multiple images into one TIFF file.

Explanation:
1.	glob.glob(): Fetches all .jpg files from a specified directory.
2.	Image.open(): Opens each JPEG image.
3.	save_all=True: Ensures that the TIFF file will be multi-page.
4.	append_images=image_list: Appends all additional images to the first one to create a multi-page TIFF.
